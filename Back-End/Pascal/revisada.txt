1 (i push my fingers into my) eyes
2 it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
3 but it's made of all the things i have to take
4 jesus it never ends, it pushs its way inside
5 if the pain goes on
6 i have screamed until my veins collapsed
7 i waited as my time's elapsed
8 now all i do is live with so much fate
9 i've wished for this, i've bitched at that
10 i've left behind this little fact
11 you cannot kill what you did not create
12 i've gotta say what i've gotta say
13 and then i swear i'll go away
14 but i can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
15 i guess i'll save the best for last
16 my future seems like one big past
17 you're left with me 'cause you left me no choice
18 i push my fingers into my eyes
19 it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
20 if the pain goes on i'm not gonna make it!
21 put me back together
22 or separate the skin from bone
23 leave me all the pieces
24 then you can leave me alone
25 tell me the reality
26 is better than the dream
27 but i found out the hard way
28 nothing is what it seems!
29 i push my fingers into my eyes
30 it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
31 but it's made of all
32 the things i have to take
33 jesus it never ends
34 it pushs its way inside
35 if the pain goes on
36 i'm not gonna make it!
37 all i've got
38 all i've got is insane!
39 all i've got
40 all i've got is insane!
41 all i've got!
42 all i've got is insane!
43 all i've got!
44 all i've got is insane!
45 i push my fingers into my eyes
46 it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
47 but it's made of all
48 the things i have to take
49 jesus it never ends
50 it pushs its way inside
51 if the pain goes on
52 i'm not gonna make it!
