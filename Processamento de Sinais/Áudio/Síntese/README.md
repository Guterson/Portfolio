## About

This project consist in a musical keyboard with voices (timbres) created by additive synthesis. It was developed as a graduation class project and stopped by the end of the term.

The synthesizer was designed in [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and the GUI was designed in the Matlab's [App Designer](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer.html) tool. The code for the App Designer can be found [here](https://github.com/Guterson/Portfolio/blob/main/Processamento%20de%20Sinais/%C3%81udio/S%C3%ADntese/SintetizadorDigitalInterface.mlapp) and a installable version can be found [here](https://github.com/Guterson/Portfolio/blob/main/Processamento%20de%20Sinais/%C3%81udio/S%C3%ADntese/App.rar).

There are two manuals, one for the [user](https://github.com/Guterson/Portfolio/blob/main/Processamento%20de%20Sinais/%C3%81udio/S%C3%ADntese/Manual_do_Usuario.pdf) and one for [coders](https://github.com/Guterson/Portfolio/blob/main/Processamento%20de%20Sinais/%C3%81udio/S%C3%ADntese/Manual_Tecnico.pdf), but both of them are written in :brazil: portuguese.
